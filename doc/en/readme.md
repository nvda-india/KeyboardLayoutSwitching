## Background

When multiple keyboard layouts of a language are installed, the menu used for switching between these layouts is not accessible. This add on is written to make this menu accessible. 

## TLDR usage instructions

When on the desktop, if user wants to switch keyboard layout for the chosen language, pressing NVDA+k opens the menu and then user can navigate it using arrow keys.
